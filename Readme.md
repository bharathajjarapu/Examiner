# 📘 Answer Comparator

This project is a cool tool for comparing text-based answers! Whether you upload text or an image, it processes the input, compares it to a reference answer, and tells you how similar they are. 🎯

---

## ✨ Features
- **Text or Image Input**: Compare answers by typing text or uploading an image.
- **OCR Integration**: Uses [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) to extract text from images. 🖼️ ➡️ ✍️
- **Cosine Similarity**: Implements a mathematical formula to measure similarity between the input and the reference answer. 🧮

---

## 📐 Cosine Similarity: The Math Behind It
Cosine Similarity calculates the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. For text, the vectors are based on word counts or embeddings.

### Formula:
```latex
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|}
```

- **Numerator**: Dot product of vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \).
- **Denominator**: Product of the magnitudes of \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \).

The result is between **0** (completely different) and **1** (identical). Values closer to **1** mean the answers are more similar! 💯

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Choose Input Type**: Select between text or image.
2. **Extract Text (if Image)**: If an image is uploaded, Tesseract.js extracts the text.
3. **Vectorize the Text**: Both inputs are converted into numerical vectors.
4. **Compare Answers**: Cosine similarity is calculated to show how close the input is to the reference.
